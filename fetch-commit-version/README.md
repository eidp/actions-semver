# Fetch commit Version (Action)

The fetch-commit-version component executes the [`commit_version`](../github_semver/commit_version.py) script which 
downloads the version artifact from the last successful workflow run for the current commit.

The corresponding version is stored as `COMMIT_VERSION` environment variable and set as output of this action.

This pipeline is supposed to be run for releases only.

This action requires a GitHub token with the following permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
```
