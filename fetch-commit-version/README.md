# Fetch commit Version (Action)

The fetch-commit-version component executes the [`commit_version`](../github_semver/commit_version.py) script which  downloads the version artifact from the last successful workflow run for the current commit. The corresponding version is stored as `COMMIT_VERSION` environment variable and set as output of this action. This pipeline is supposed to be run for releases only.
The GitHub token needs to have `actions: read` permission to be able to access the workflow runs.
